  2. **Add the Tracking Script**
     
     Add this script to your website's `<head>` section:

     ```html
     <script 
       async 
       src="https://affiliation-three.vercel.app/affiliationhub.js" 
       data-affiliationhub="YOUR-PUBLIC-ID">
     </script>
     ```

     <Note>
       Find your unique public ID in Account Settings -> Integrations.
       Add this script to your landing page, or better, to every page to never miss a referral.
       The script is lightweight (~4KB) and adds a global `affiliationhub` variable to your window object.
     </Note>

  3. **Implement Referral Tracking**
     
     Access referral data in your code:

     ```javascript
     // Access referral data from the global object
     const referralId = window.affiliationhub_referral;
     ```

     <Warning>
       Always verify the referral object exists before accessing it.
     </Warning>
</Steps>

## Stripe Integration Examples

### With Stripe Checkout

```javascript
const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  success_url: 'https://example.com/success',
  cancel_url: 'https://example.com/cancel',
  metadata: { 
    affiliationhub_referral: req.body.referral 
  },
  line_items: [
    { price: 'price_xxx', quantity: 1 }
  ],
  mode: 'subscription',
});
```

### With Stripe Subscriptions

```javascript
const subscription = await stripe.subscriptions.create({
  customer: 'cus_xxx',
  metadata: { 
    affiliationhub_referral: req.body.referral 
  },
  items: [
    { price: 'price_xxx' }
  ],
});
```

<Note>
  Send the referral ID from client-side to your backend server via params, query, or body, 
  then include it in Stripe metadata when creating checkout sessions or subscriptions.
